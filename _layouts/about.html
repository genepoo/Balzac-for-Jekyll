<p>I'm a computational biologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In an earlier life I was a Chemical Engineer, 
and that early foundation guides how I think about a lot of the problems I try to solve in the lab. 
The majority of my projects have used proteomics and high-throughput cellular phenotypic data to design and understand treatment for 
glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor with quick and high mortality. </p>

<p>I have a weakness for cats, science-fiction and Indian classical music. I occasionally tweet about science 
and music @gene_poo.</p>
