I'm a computational biologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In an earlier life I was a Chemical Engineer and that early foundation guides how I think about a lot of the problems I try to solve in the lab. The majority of my projects have used proteomics and high-throughput cellular phenotypic data to design and understand treatment for glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor with quick and high mortality. 

I have a weakness for cats, science-fiction and Indian classical music. I occasionally tweet about science and music @gene_poo.
